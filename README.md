# rock-paper-scissors

This is the third project of the Odin Project curriculum. In this project we, the learners, are coding a Rock, paper, scissors game. For the moment the game will have no graphical interface. One will be able to play the game in the browser console. However, a little bit later in the curriculum we will add a graphical interface as well.

Two players will play the game. Human and computer.

To code this game I will need to use functions, conditionals, for loop, and a couple of JavaScript methods. 

UPDATE:
Graphical User Interface added (GUI). The game can now be played through it (through GUI) on the browser, using the buttons and following the instructions.
To add GUI I used the DOM to create and select elements and classes. 
Afterwards, I added css and some styles in my attempt to make it somewhat eye-pleasing.
