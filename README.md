# rock-paper-scissors

This is the third project of the Odin Project carriculum. In this project we, the learners, are coding a Rock, paper, scsissors game. For the moment the game will have no graphical interface. One will be able to play the game in the JavaScript console. However, a little bit later in the carriculum we will add a graphical interface as well.

Two players will play the game. Human and computer.

To code this game I will need to use functions, conditionals, for loop, and a couple of JavaScript methods.
